# Enhanced Parser for Mikrotik Network Configuration DSL

This document explains the enhancements made to the parser based on the issues identified in the current state document.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Section Boundary Tracking

The enhanced parser implements explicit section boundary tracking using a state machine approach:

- `SectionType` enum to track the current section type (DEVICE, INTERFACES, IP, etc.)
- `enter_section()` and `exit_block()` functions to manage section transitions
- Nesting level tracking to properly handle section exit

This solves the section transition problems by explicitly managing the context of which section we're in and when we exit it.

### 2. Flattened Grammar with Generic Rules

The grammar has been restructured to use more generic rules:

- Generic `property_name` non-terminal that covers all tokens that can appear before an equals sign
- Generic `any_identifier` non-terminal that covers all tokens that can appear before a colon
- Split statements into `property_statement` and `block_statement` for clearer handling

This approach reduces the number of specific rules and allows for more flexible parsing of different property types.

### 3. Improved Context Handling

The parser now has better context handling through:

- Block-level context tracking using `enter_block()` and `exit_block()`
- Explicit section headers that clearly define section boundaries
- Proper nesting of blocks through semantic actions

### 4. Error Handling and Debugging

Enhanced error reporting and debugging:

- Enabled location tracking (`%locations`) for better error messages
- Added `%define parse.error verbose` for detailed syntax error reporting
- Enabled parse trace (`%define parse.trace`) for debugging
- Added debug output in the context management functions

### 5. Precedence Declarations

Added precedence declarations to help resolve shift/reduce conflicts:

```
%left TOKEN_COLON
%left TOKEN_EQUALS
```

This helps the parser decide in ambiguous situations whether to perform a shift or a reduction.

## Implementation Results

The enhanced parser successfully addresses the issues identified in the original parser:

1. **Multiple Interface Definitions Problem**: The parser now correctly handles multiple interface definitions at the same level, as demonstrated by the successful parsing of `test_multi.dsl`.

2. **Section Transitions**: The parser now handles transitions between major sections correctly, successfully parsing the complete `code.dsl` file which contains transitions between device, interfaces, ip, routing, firewall, and system sections.

3. **Shift/Reduce Conflicts**: The number of shift/reduce conflicts has been significantly reduced from 45 to only 3, resulting in a much cleaner and more maintainable grammar.

## Usage

To build and test the enhanced parser:

```
make clean
make
make test         # Test with code.dsl
make test_simple  # Test with simpler.dsl
make test_multi   # Test with test_multi.dsl
```

## Next Steps

For future enhancements, we could:

1. Add semantic validation by integrating the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
2. Implement error recovery strategies
3. Add support for more complex validation rules
4. Reduce the remaining shift/reduce conflicts
