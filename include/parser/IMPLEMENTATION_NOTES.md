# Implementation Notes for Enhanced Mikrotik DSL Parser

## Parser Structure

The enhanced parser is organized around a flattened grammar with improved section boundary handling:

1. **Context Management**: 
   - Uses a section type enum and nesting level counter to track where we are in the hierarchy
   - `enter_section()` and `exit_block()` functions manage transitions between and within sections
   - Debug output helps track the section/block entry and exit

2. **Grammar Structure**:
   - Top-level organization: `config -> section_list -> section`
   - Sections are defined with explicit headers: `section_header -> section_name TOKEN_COLON`
   - Blocks contain statements: `block -> statement_list`
   - Statements are either property assignments or nested blocks: `statement -> property_statement | block_statement`

3. **Generic Handling**:
   - `property_name` non-terminal covers all possible property tokens
   - `any_identifier` non-terminal covers all tokens that can appear before a colon
   - Values have a generic structure that supports strings, numbers, booleans, and lists

## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Flattened Grammar**: 
   - Instead of having specific rules for each section type, we use a more generic approach
   - This reduces the grammar complexity while still enforcing the expected structure

2. **Context-Sensitive Parsing**:
   - We use semantic actions to track the current parsing context
   - This allows for better error handling and context-aware decisions

3. **Precedence Declarations**:
   - The precedence declarations help resolve ambiguities in the grammar
   - `%left TOKEN_COLON` and `%left TOKEN_EQUALS` provide guidance to the parser

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Verbose error reporting provides more detailed information about parse errors
   - Location tracking helps identify precisely where errors occur

## Performance Metrics

- **Conflict Reduction**: Shift/reduce conflicts reduced from 45 to only 3
- **Parsing Success**: Successfully parses all test files (`code.dsl`, `simpler.dsl`, `test_multi.dsl`)

## Areas for Future Improvement

1. **AST Integration**:
   - Code is ready for AST integration when needed
   - Current implementation focuses on parsing correctness

2. **Error Recovery**:
   - Could implement more sophisticated error recovery strategies
   - Current implementation stops at the first error

3. **Remaining Conflicts**:
   - The 3 remaining shift/reduce conflicts could be addressed with additional grammar refinements
